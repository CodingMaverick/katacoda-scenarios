Once a file has been added to the staging area it needs to be committed to the repository. The command `git commit -m "commit message"` moves files from staging to the repository and records the time/date, author and a commit message that can be used to add additional context and reasoning to the changes such as a bug report number.

Only changes added to the staging area will be committed, any files in the working directory that have not been staged will not be included.
