The command `git log` allows you to view the history of the repository and the commit log. You can also view the actual changes in the commits using the command `git show`. If you want to view an specific commit's changes, you can do so by using the command `git show <commit-hash>`


## Task

- List the log of changes to your repository: `git log`{{execute}}
- View the last commit's changes: `git show`{{execute}}
- BONUS: Try this one for an improved output format: `git log --pretty=format:"%h %an %ar - %s"`{{execute}}
